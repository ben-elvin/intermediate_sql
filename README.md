# Welcome to the Intermediate SQL Project Repository!

This project is designed to help students at WBS Coding School enhance their SQL skills beyond the basics. Through a series of practical lessons and challenges, students will gain the knowledge and confidence needed to tackle intermediate SQL tasks and prepare for technical interviews.

## About the Project

The Intermediate SQL Project was developed specifically for students at WBS Coding School. It provides a structured learning path that builds on foundational SQL knowledge and introduces more advanced concepts and techniques. This project aims to bridge the gap between basic SQL proficiency and the advanced skills required in technical interviews and real-world applications.

## Key Features

### Hands-On Lessons

- **Interactive SQL Lessons**: This repository includes a series of hands-on SQL lessons designed to be run locally. These lessons cover a range of intermediate topics, providing practical examples and exercises to reinforce learning.

### Intermediate SQL Topics

- **Window Functions**: Gain insights into using window functions for advanced data analysis and complex calculations.
- **Subqueries**: Understand how to write and optimise subqueries for more efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Learn how to use CTEs to write more readable and maintainable SQL queries.
- **Temporary Tables**: Explore the use of temporary tables to handle intermediate data processing and complex queries.
- **Stored Routines**: Get hands-on experience with stored routines, including:
  - **Stored Views**: Learn to create and use stored views to simplify complex queries.
  - **Stored Functions**: Develop stored functions to encapsulate reusable logic.
  - **Stored Procedures**: Automate and enhance database operations with stored procedures.

## Learning Platform

The interactive lessons in this repository are complemented by a comprehensive learning platform provided by WBS Coding School. This platform offers detailed explanations, video tutorials, and additional resources to deepen your understanding of intermediate SQL topics. Please note that the learning platform itself is not included in this repository but is an essential companion to the hands-on exercises.

## Challenges and Practice

In addition to the lessons, there is a series of SQL challenges designed to test and reinforce your skills. These challenges are intended to provide practical, real-world scenarios that you might encounter in technical interviews. While these challenges are not included in the repository, they form a critical part of the overall learning experience.

## Preparing for Technical Interviews

This project is specifically designed to prepare students for technical interviews. By the end of this project, you will have:

- **Enhanced Problem-Solving Skills**: Improved your ability to solve complex SQL problems efficiently.
- **In-Depth SQL Knowledge**: Gained a deeper understanding of intermediate SQL concepts and techniques.
- **Interview Readiness**: Built the confidence and skills needed to perform well in SQL-related technical interviews.

## Encouraging Mastery and Innovation

At WBS Coding School, we encourage students to strive for mastery and innovation. Use the skills and knowledge gained from this project to tackle more advanced SQL tasks, optimise database performance, and develop innovative solutions to data challenges.

Happy querying, and enjoy your journey into the world of intermediate SQL!
